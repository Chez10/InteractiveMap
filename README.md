# InteractiveMap

Colaborators: Kevin Sanchez Criado, Marcos Aldana 
Group project based on building an interactive map that displays information when you hover the mouse on top of a location. It is based on a map of a childhood game, and using Java we made it to show the names of locations and enemies you can encounter.
